MEW_visnov_flavor.0.desc:0 "After Star, Marco, and Eclipsa spent a few minutes at the castle's flower garden, Star seemed less frantic and more calm. She admitted that she might have done something rash, and now she is more determined than ever to help in the right way. Though a few officials are annoyed that Eclipsa took that time to do this for Star, some are pointing out that Star could have caused problems if she hadn't "chillaxed.""

MEW_visnov_flavor.1.desc:0 "A few hours after Star and Marco were sent to the rose garden, an explosion rocked Skywynne Institute. Apparently, Star and Marco escaped the castle and went over there because Star "couldn't sit around like a princess while everyone out there suffered!" While there, they found a group of students trapped in a building. They decided to save their lives, which involved blowing up some load-bearing rubble that blocked the path. The explosion and collapse caused a fire, which engulfed many priceless records and artifacts.\n\nWhile the common peasants are certainly grateful, the nobles are furious because of the amount of money that went up in flames. Marco tried to take sole blame but nobody believed that calm and calculated boy. Eclipsa took Star in for a "scolding," but secretly praised her. Either way, nobles have only gotten angrier."

She could come out and take advantage of the disaterous situation right now. Also, people who go against the Kingdom of Mewni deserve to be ousted.\n\nThose in favor of forgiveness argue that most of Mina's fighters were brought under Mina's magic and they had no choice. They also say that many feared for their lives if they didnt join up.\n\nIt seems that no matter what we did, we wouldn't have been able to avoid this rise in extremism."

MEW_mina.1.desc:0 "As part of the efforts to track down Mina Loveberry, it has been deemed fit to put up a bounty for her capture and arrest. Traditionally, the reward is only given if the criminal in question is taken to the government alive. However, Mina is a special case. This has made the option of awarding the death of Mina an alluring possibility\n\nOn one hand, awarding bounty hunters in case of her death would increase the amount of people going after her. It's also possible that she gets taken alive anyway.\n\nOn the other hand, Mina has already been defeated. She's probably homeless on the streets of the cleaved zone, and wont be causing Mewni problems anytime soon. Also, posting a death warrant makes Mina a cornered animal. We can kiss any possibility of her turning herself in goodbye. And on the public side of things, awarding only her live capture lines up with Mewman expectations of "Status Quo," and would be a sing to the people that things are getting back to normal."

I've been sent from Butterfly Castle to escort you back. Something very strange has happened, we need you at the throne! Globgor's waiting for you there as well."\n\nEclipsa simply nodded, and hopped on behind the knight. With a "Hiya!" they were off at full gallop.\n\nAt first, there was a distinct silence. But as they approached closer and closer to their destination, the chaos grew. Mass bands fleeing west, buildings collapsed for seemingly no reason, and the like. As they finally reached the Castle, Eclipsa got off and took in the sight. Flames, screams, rubble. Butterfly Castle itself was in chaos.\n\nShe put her fists on her hips, and in her royal way of speaking, said..."
