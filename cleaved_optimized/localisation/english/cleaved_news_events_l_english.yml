cleaving_news.0.desc.a:0 "A great change has stricken Mewni! 1: Locations of places have shifted completely, much of the Kingdom is diconnected! 2: Almost all of magic has stopped working, the Magic High Commision just disintegrated to dust! and 3: A large part of the Kingdom seems to have 'merged' with another, unknown, civilization. And Butterfly Castle itself has been merged with them!\n\nNot all is bad, though. Mina Loveberry's magic has also ceased, stopping the coup what was occuring just hours before. The magic needed for magic creatures and Kingdoms to exist and keep in contact still works. Finally, the civilization merged with us is comprised of people like us. That is to say, not Monsters"

Said event is not fully understood at the current time, but the Government of Oregon has released a statement saying that the event will be treated like a natural disaster. The Government of California, the state which seems most affected, has not yet released an official statement. In addition, the status of it's Governor is unknown.\n\nEffects of the event include earthquakes, wildfires, the ‘merging’ of objects, alterations in the landscape and geography, and most strange of all: a rise in the sightings of cryptids. Casualties are confirmed. Travel is not advised."

cleaving_news.1.desc.a:0 "After a couple weeks the nature of this crisis, which has been named the Cleaving, has revealed itself: We have merged with the Dimension of Earth!\n\nEarth, which Princess Star Butterfly is very familiar with, is a vast dimension much larger than our own. We have merged with the West Coast of the United States, this Dimension's dominant nation. Though some of Mewni merged with the Ocean, much of it has merged with American Reigons. There has already been minor conflicts over the "Cleaved Zone," and it will surely escalate in future years.\n\nWith magic gone, Mewni will have to catch up technologically if we ever hope to restore full Mewman rule over the Cleaved Zone."
cleaving_news.1.desc.b:0 "After a couple weeks the nature of the crisis on the west coast, which has been named the Cleaving, has revealed itself: Some sort of landmass has "merged" with Nevada, California, and parts of the Pacific. Further more, an entire nation and thousands of people have come with it!\n\nThe "Kingdom of Mewni" is an absolute monarchy, with Queen Eclipsa at the top. Apparently they had been going through a coup by one Mina Loveberry at the time of the Cleaving, and the Cleaving may have been the result of an action intended to thwart her. Most strangely, they claim to have "Magical Powers" that were lost upon the Cleaving.\n\nMuch of their land has merged with ours; we will likley have conflicts over it."
