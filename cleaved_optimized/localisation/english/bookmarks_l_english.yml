Despite it's current domestic problems, the United States of America is still a relativley stable country. US soil has not seen war for over a century, and while unrest still rises from time to time, law and order has always prevailed.\n\nHowever, the coming years will test this domestic peace. the COVID Pandemic, the storming of the US Capitol, the proclimation of CHAZ, this will all hit America hard. However, down in Socal, the most devestating blow is about to take place. Thousands will die, tens of thousands will be wounded, hundreds of thousands will be displaced. The stock market will crash, radicalism will surge, and new nations will make themsleves known. Nothing like it has ever or will ever been seen again. It will truly be something... out of this world."

Daisy dukes, Bikinis on top, Sun-kissed skin, it really is a beautiful place if you ignore the Fent-heads.
